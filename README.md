# ‚ùÑÔ∏è React Weather App : 
- A dynamic weather app created for all types of devices. By default, Users get to view the current temperature in Stockholm. User get to clik/tap on the get location button to view the current location temperature. The look & feel is designed to create a soft and fun look for Users to use. 
- It was fun designing & implementing my first ever react app! The api weather app frome: https://openweathermap.org/. The components was implemented to
easily maintain and clean code.
